  <h2>Founder | Real Estate Investor | Community Revitalizer</h2>

  <img src="group-photo.jpeg" alt="Go Time! Team" class="group-photo">

    <p>Chris Boley and the Go Time! team transform neglected properties into profitable, high-performing assets — and in the process, brings new life to entire neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>Chris grew up with hardship. After his father was incarcerated, he moved with his mother and four siblings from New York to Sacramento, where they shared a single rented room. Those early years taught him what instability feels like — and planted the seed of his mission: to create quality housing, build community, and generate long-term wealth through real estate.</p>

    <p>Starting as a contractor, Chris built his business from the foundation up. Today, he’s owned over 2,000 units, manages more than $100 million in assets, and has flipped over 300 properties, generating $80M+ in profits for investors — all while staying true to his mission.</p>

    <h2>The Mission: Revitalize & Multiply</h2>

    <p>Chris specializes in buying and repositioning neglected, underperforming multifamily properties in working-class areas — often overlooked by institutional capital. He and his team breathe new life into these buildings through targeted renovations, operational efficiency, and responsible management.</p>

    <h3>Why it works:</h3>
    <div class="list-container">
    <ul>
        <li>These assets are acquired below replacement cost.</li>
        <li>Demand for clean, affordable housing is massive and growing.</li>
        <li>Cosmetic and operational improvements dramatically increase value.</li>
        <li>Strong cash flow and equity growth are unlocked in under 24 months.</li>
        <li>Local pride and community stability are restored — increasing tenant retention and asset value long-term.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <blockquote style="font-size:0.9rem;">“We don’t just flip buildings — we flip blocks. When you clean up a property, plant trees, repaint exteriors, fix lighting, and screen tenants properly — crime goes down, values go up, and families get a better life. And our investors get strong, stable returns backed by real assets.” <br/><em>— Chris Boley</em></blockquote>
